    <h1>Naruto Tribute Page</h1>
    <p><strong>Naruto</strong> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
        It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams
        of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.<i> Naruto</i> is the fourth best-selling manga series
        in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries, with 153 million
        of the sales in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere.</p>
    <p>It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes
        have appeared on <i>USA Today</i> and <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list several times, and the seventh
        volume
        won a Quill Award in 2006.</p>
    <p>Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though
        some
        felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme,
        makes use
        of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</p>
